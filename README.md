# **Basic Boilerplate project for a React Application**
---
### **_The What and Why_**
This is a little boilerplate set up for bare-bones dev projects, mostly for personal use. I wanted a way to apply all my skills without the need to spend so much time just setting up everything _before_ I can actually get to code, so I decided to put up a boilerplate project that had basically everything I needed to start.

### **_What Is Used_**
- JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- NodeJS, ExpressJS
- React, React Redux, Redux Saga
- Axios
- PostgreSQL
- Material UI

All of the above is already installed. All that is required is that you run the command below in terminal once you have it cloned to your device:
```javascript
npm install
```

After which, you can open this in code and type the following command to have it open up in your browser, localhost:5006.
```javascript
npm run server
npm run client
```
Once running, all that should show up on the DOM is the h1 ```'Sup, bruh'``` in the App.jsx.

### **Device Prerequisites**
I have **Postgres** and **Postico** installed on my device to handle database SQL, while I also have **VS Code** as my chosen source code editor.
